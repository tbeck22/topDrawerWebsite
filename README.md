Gallery website to showcase Artist Work

Top Drawer is a gallery website that showcases the work of upcoming artists and photographers. 
I'm currently still in the process of adding the final content but the main fucntionality of 
the website is all there. Please take a look.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the first website I've ever made. I'm very new to web development and although it was 
quite an ambitious project for me to undertake I'm very happy with the outcome. I used HTML,
CSS, JavaScript and JQuery to produce the website. 

I'm open to any advice or feedback on the website. Furthermore, I would enjoy hearing how you 
think I could improve it.

Thanks for taking a look,

Troy Beckett
